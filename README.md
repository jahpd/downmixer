# downmixer

Donwmix is a process where multichannel audio (like 5.1, in this project) is encoded to stereo channels; this was made by some engineers to give us in medias like DVD, some perception of same auralization in 5.1 channels. It's not perfect, because we lost much information.

In our downmix process, idealized by Prof. Dr. J.A.Mannis, we try to reduce some of the problems inherent to downmix process, as no simulation of acoustic shadows. This gave us the opportunity for a better sound experience of materials on two channels that were originally multichannel.

# TODO

- Choose the best reduction coefficients and filter coefficients in low-pass filters
